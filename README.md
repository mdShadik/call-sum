# Welcome to CALL SUMMARIZER!

Hi! 
**Call Summarizer** is a web app to summarize your call into the key insights to understand within some lines only. I have used **Next JS** in this project. I've harnessed the power of OpenAI's APIs for both speech-to-text and text summarization. OpenAI offers exceptional capabilities that enhance our app's functionality.


**Let me give you an overview of how 'Call Summarizer' works.**

## Upload audio files

-   "To get started, users can upload audio files, but we only accept WAV or MP3 formats."

-   "If a user tries to upload the wrong file type, a helpful error popup appears."

-   "We provide an audio player to allow users to verify the correctness of the uploaded audio."

-   "The 'Summarize' button is disabled until the user selects a correct audio file."


## Summarization Process

- "When the user clicks '**Summarize this call recording button**,' a modal popup appears in the center of the screen."


"I've also added a 'Convert Next' button, which streamlines the process of summarizing multiple audio files."
"Our app is designed with responsive design in mind, ensuring it works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes."

# Conclusion
- In conclusion, 'Call Summarizer' simplifies the process of summarizing call recordings, thanks to OpenAI's APIs and my user-friendly design.
